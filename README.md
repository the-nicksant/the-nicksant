## Hey, you can call me Nick 👋

I build software that's easy to use and makes sense for the people using it. As a [product-minded developer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer), I care about the big picture and how my code helps the business grow. 

I like hearing directly from users about their pains so I can find the best ways to fix them. I think the best part of engineering is staying curious and never being afraid to ask questions.

I'm loving building my own projects and you can check the progress of some of them:
